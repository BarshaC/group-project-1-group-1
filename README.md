Group Info: This is Group 1 for the Group Project 1. The group members are Barsha, Bria, and Richelle (group leader). 
Responsibilities: Richelle was responsible for updating the markdown cells, and checking to ensure the Jupyter Notebook matched the project expectations. 
Goals: Our goal with this project was to take a simple data set and organize it to be readable, understandable, and useful. We did this by focusing on the relevant information that could help us make reasonable inferences about how users interact with their mobile devices. 
Summary of Files in the Repo: We've included the Jupyer Notebook for the project, as well as the original and modified CSV files. The Jupyter Notebook was worked on individually by group members, but we came together to review our work. The original CSV file was downloaded from Kaggle and exported to Microsoft Exel, where we were able to see all of the columns and determine which information would be most helpful. The modified CSV file is the result of the codes run in the Juptyer Notebook, and it has been cleaned and organized.
